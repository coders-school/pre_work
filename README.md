# C++ training pre-work

The project is configured to run on Windows, Linux and MacOS. It uses CMake >= 3.6

## Software for remote sessions

I highly recommend to use **Visual Studio Code** with **Live Share Extension Pack** installed. It will allow us to have a remote Coding Dojo session and to have an audio chat during this session. [Take a look on this extension in action](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/services/live-share/). In case you do not have it or do not want it, you will just have to do group tasks on your own.

## Software installation for Windows

- Download and install your favourite IDE - CLion, VS Code (free), QtCreator (free) or any other that can handle CMake builds
- Download MinGW compiler (g++, make, cmake, gdb)
or 
- Download and install Visual Studio Community Edition (IDE + MSVC compiler)

## Software installation for Linux

For Linux please install:
- your favourite IDE - CLion (paid), VS Code (free), QtCreator (free), vim or any other that can handle CMake builds
- g++ >= 7 or clang++ >= 5
- valgrind
- cmake >= 3.6
- make
- gdb
- binutils

## Possible problems on Windows

If you can build `NumberGenerators` target, but you cannot build `NumberGenerators-ut` target it probably means that MinGW does not properly support exceptions on your machine. Please reinstall MinGW and select another type of exception implementation in `Exception` field.

If MinGW is problematic on your machine, feel free to use MSVC compiler. In fact, compiler type does not really matter. Just make sure it supports C++17.

Also if CLion is problematic, you can use Visual Studio Community Edition.

You need to be able to compile both `NumberGenerators` and `NumberGenerators-ut` targets. We will be using similar build configurations in our training.

## Online IDE

If you have any problems with setting up an environment you can use [Repl.it](https://repl.it). It is an online IDE that can handle multiple files projects and has a linux terminal available.

## Assignment

1. Optional: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account (if you have one).
2. Compile the binary and unit tests. Steps for manual compilation in console with CMake:
  ```bash
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ..
  > make
  ```
3. Run `NumberGenerators` target. `Result: 42` should be displayed on the output.
4. Run `NumberGenerators-ut` target.
5. Fix mistakes in unit tests. In order to do that you need to implement `sumNumbersFromGenerators()` function to make all UTs pass. You can add more UTs if you wish.
6. Create a Pull Request to inform me about your successful implementation and environment setup. If you do not have and do not want to have a GitHub account just send me your solution (diff only) via email to *lukasz@coders.school*
